Welcome! Since this is your first run of the app, i will guide you through its usage!
First, to talk to me, you simply press on your screen once, and you will hear a beep, along with a short
vibration. Secondly, the available commands are the following; Set alarm, make a call, add a new contact,
date and time, find your location, send a text message or listen to music. For example, if you wish to
set an alarm simply say set an alarm, or say, set an alarm for 11:55. OK, now that you know how to use me;
tell me how can i help you?
